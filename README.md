# Mysterious Chromium Crash

On My Machineâ„¢

This HTML crashes Chromium browsers on M1 Macbook Pro 2021 when I click the 'X'.

``` html
<html>
  <body>
    <select>
      <option>11 1</option>
    </select>
    X
  </body>
</html>
```

I need to have at least 'cc c' ('c' being any character). 'c c' doesn't make browsers crash, neither does 'cccc', or 'c cc'.
